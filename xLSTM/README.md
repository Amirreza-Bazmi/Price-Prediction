# Bitcoin Price Prediction with xLSTM

This project leverages the **Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM)** architecture for predicting Bitcoin prices. xLSTM enhances traditional LSTM networks by introducing exponential gating and modified memory structures, enabling more efficient handling of sequential data and improved performance in time series forecasting.

## ðŸ“Š Overview of the Project

### Objective
To develop a predictive model for Bitcoin prices using the advanced xLSTM architecture, capitalizing on its enhanced capabilities to capture complex temporal dependencies in financial time series data.

### Dataset
- Historical Bitcoin price data, including:
  - Open, High, Low, Close prices.
  - Trading volume.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Normalize data for efficient training.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - xLSTM layers for capturing advanced sequential dependencies.
   - Fully connected layers for regression output.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train the model on historical price data.
   - Evaluate predictions against actual prices.
